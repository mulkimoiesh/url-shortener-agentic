# URL Shortener + Agentic SDLC Orchestrator

## Project Overview

A URL shortener product, built and evolved not by hand but by a governed, agentic orchestration layer that runs a real software development lifecycle — requirements → architecture → implementation → testing → guardrails → documentation → release — as an auditable graph with human approval gates, not a linear script.

Two independently runnable Spring Boot applications in one Gradle build:

- **`shortener-service`** — the product: a URL shortener REST API (create, redirect, click-count stats).
- **`agent-orchestrator`** — the orchestration layer: reads the product's real source tree, plans changes with an LLM, writes and validates them in an isolated per-run workspace, runs the product's real test suite, and only ever touches the live product after every gate is explicitly human-approved.

```

A request enters through `WorkflowController`, which delegates all routing to `WorkflowEngine`. The engine drives one shared `WorkflowState` through the seven agents in sequence (with gates, retries, and blocks along the way — see [`docs/02-Agent-Orchestration.md`](docs/02-Agent-Orchestration.md)), acting only on an isolated workspace copy of the product, never the live tree directly. See [`docs/07-Diagrams.md`](docs/07-Diagrams.md) for the full set of detailed diagrams (sequence, state lifecycle, per-scenario flows, retry mechanism).

## Features

- **Governed SDLC graph** — 7 stages (Requirements, Architecture, Implementation, Testing, Guardrails, Documentation, Release), each backed by a real agent, with 3 human approval gates.
- **Bounded, feedback-carrying retry** — a failed implementation attempt is retried (up to 2×) with the prior failure's exact context, then safely rolled back rather than looping forever.
- **Deterministic guardrails** — real static-analysis checks (secrets, key-shaped strings, duplicate classes, package integrity) that can block a run pending explicit human resolution.
- **Workspace isolation** — every run operates on its own full copy of the repo; the live product is untouched until an explicit, gated `apply` call.
- **Test-impact awareness** — a production change that alters an existing class's public shape automatically pulls in the tests that reference it, so they get fixed alongside the code that broke them.
- **Full audit trail & metrics** — an append-only decision log per run, plus computed retry counts, gate-pass counts, and mean-time-to-recovery.
- **Provider-agnostic LLM layer** — mock (deterministic, zero-cost), Groq, and Anthropic backends behind one interface; swapping providers is a config change, not a code change.

## Technology Stack

- **Language / Runtime:** Java 17
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.5 (Web, Validation, JPA)
- **AI Integration:** Spring AI (Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible clients, used for Groq)
- **Persistence (product):** JPA / H2
- **Build:** Gradle (multi-module)
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test

## Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites:** Java 17, Gradle (or your IDE's bundled Gradle), `curl` + `python3` (only for the scenario demo scripts).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd url-shortener-agentic
./gradlew build
```

**LLM provider (optional):** the orchestrator defaults to `app.llm.mode: mock` — no key needed, fully deterministic. To use a real model, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `GROQ_API_KEY` and change `app.llm.mode` in `agent-orchestrator/src/main/resources/application.yml`.

## How to Run

```bash
./gradlew :shortener-service:bootRun       # product, on :8080
./gradlew :agent-orchestrator:bootRun      # orchestrator, on :8081
```

> **IntelliJ users:** always launch via the Gradle task above (or the checked-in `.run/OrchestratorApplication.run.xml` configuration), not a bare `java` run on `OrchestratorApplication` — Gradle sets the module working directory that `app.codebase.repo-root` depends on.

Interact with the orchestrator via its REST API (Postman, curl, or the scenario scripts below):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/workflow/runs` | Start a run |
| POST | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}/approve` | Approve the current gate |
| POST | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}/resolve-block` | Resolve a guardrail block |
| POST | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}/apply` | Copy a `COMPLETED` run's changes into the live product |
| GET | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}` | Full run state |
| GET | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}/audit` | Full decision log |
| GET | `/api/v1/workflow/runs/{id}/metrics` | Reliability metrics for the run |

## Demo Scenarios

With the orchestrator running, from another terminal:

```bash
cd scenarios
./01-greenfield.sh      # build-from-scratch style request
./02-brownfield.sh      # real change against the existing codebase
./03-ambiguous.sh       # vague ask -> requirements agent surfaces ambiguity, human clarifies
./04-governance-demo.sh # deterministic retry-loop + guardrail-block demonstration
```

Each script prints the run's full state, audit log, and metrics at every step. See [`docs/03-Workflow-Scenarios.md`](docs/03-Workflow-Scenarios.md) for real, evidenced run excerpts of all four.
